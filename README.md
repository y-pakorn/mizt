# Mizt: Anonymous Fund Transfers with Stealth Accounts on Sui

Mizt is a fully open-source privacy DApp that introduces stealth addresses to the Sui blockchain, enabling anonymous, gasless transfers of native assetsâ€”including coins, NFTs, and objects. Live on mainnet, Mizt empowers users to manage stealth accounts entirely client-side with privacy and usability in mind.

## ðŸ”’ Key Features:

- Stealth Address Protocol: Implements a stealth address mechanism inspired by Vitalikâ€™s proposal, using Sui-native secp256k1 key pairs.

- Gasless Transfers: Uses **Enoki-sponsored transactions** with conditional signing to enable gasless sends from stealth accounts.

- Client-Side Account Management: Full local key and note discovery across multiple devicesâ€”no server, no compromise.

- Live on Mainnet: Actively operating at mizt.tetrationlab.com, focused on SUI coin transfers today, but extensible to any Sui object.

## ðŸŒ± Future Improvements:

- Full asset support: Coins, NFTs, DeFi positions, and any on-chain object.

- Meta-address recovery with Sui Name Service integration.

- Opt-in auto-yield strategies for stealth-held assets.

Mizt is one of the first (if not the first) privacy DApps live on Sui mainnet, setting the stage for composable privacy in the Sui ecosystem.
